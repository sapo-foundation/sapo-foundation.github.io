# SAPO Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2025-09-19

**Scope.** This Policy applies to the SAPO mobile app and the backend endpoints we operate solely to deliver phonetic transliteration.  
It **does not** cover:
- Third-party websites or services you access via links; or
- The independent practices of third-party service providers we rely on (e.g., AI model providers, cloud hosting).

Those third parties process data under their own terms and privacy notices.

**Who we are.** “SAPO,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the provider of the SAPO app (contact below). In this first version we do **not** offer accounts and we do **not** collect payment information. We designed SAPO to minimize data collection and retention.

---

## 1) What We Collect (Minimization by Design)

- **No identity data by default.** We do **not** ask for your name, email, phone, account handle, or payment details.  
- **No analytics/ads SDKs.** We do **not** use tracking cookies, cross-site tracking, targeted advertising, or profiling.  
- **No persistent identifiers created by us.**  
- **Transliteration content.** The text you submit and the text returned are processed **transiently** to fulfill your request.
- **Network/technical metadata.** Hosting and network providers may transiently process IP addresses, timestamps, and similar metadata to route requests, secure the service, and prevent abuse. We configure systems to avoid creating or retaining server logs that link you to content **where technically feasible**.

---

## 2) How We Use Data (and What We Don’t Do)

- **Provide the service.** We receive your input, optionally relay it to an AI model provider to compute the transliteration, and return the output.  
- **Security & reliability.** Limited technical telemetry may be processed to maintain and protect the service (e.g., rate-limiting, fraud/abuse detection).  
- **No ads, no resale.** We do **not** sell or “share” your information for cross-context behavioral advertising, and we do **not** use it for marketing.  
- **No impactful automated decisions.** We do **not** make decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects about you; we only transform text you submit.

**Our compliance approach (legal basis).**  
We rely on **legitimate interest** under applicable data protection laws (such as the GDPR) for processing user-submitted text (which may include personal data) to provide the transliteration service.

- **What is our legitimate interest.** Our interest is enabling you to submit text, process it transiently, and return a transliterated output. This is essential to deliver the service you request.  
- **Necessity.** We process only what is necessary to provide the service—no extra data, no profiling, no ads.  
- **Balancing test.** We have considered the potential impact on your rights, freedoms, and privacy. Because we do *not* store input/output permanently, do not use data for marketing, do not build profiles, and minimize metadata, we believe our interests do not override your rights.  
- **Expectations.** Users reasonably expect that text they submit for transliteration will be temporarily processed to generate the output.  
- **Right to object.** You have the right to object to our processing based on legitimate interest. If you do, we will assess whether there are overriding compelling grounds to continue; if not, we will stop processing for you.

Where consent is required by applicable law in specific jurisdictions, we will obtain it. Only the laws of your country/region apply to you.

---

## 3) Storage & Retention

- **Ephemeral by default.** We do **not** persistently store your input or output after fulfilling your request. Temporary copies exist only in memory or short-lived system buffers necessary to deliver results and keep systems secure and reliable.  
- **Technical logs.** Where limited logs or error reports are unavoidable, we strive to exclude personal data and minimize retention and access. When present, such data is purged or irreversibly de-identified as soon as feasible.  
- **Support communications.** If you contact us (e.g., to exercise rights), we retain that correspondence only as long as needed to respond and comply with law.

---

## 4) Children’s Privacy

- SAPO is **not intended for children under 13** (or higher local age thresholds, e.g., 16 in some regions).  
- We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child provided personal information, contact us so we can delete what is available.

---

## 5) Security

- **In transit.** Transport Layer Security (TLS).  
- **Access controls.** Principle of least privilege, key management, and hardened infrastructure.  
- **Vendor safeguards.** Contractual and technical measures with processors to protect data.  
- **Incident response.** If a personal-data breach creates risk to individuals, we will notify affected users and regulators as required.

*No system is perfectly secure, but our minimization approach reduces risk.*

---

## 6) Your Privacy Rights (Global)

Depending on where you live, you may have the right to **access/know**, **delete/erase**, **correct**, **port**, **object/restrict** certain processing, **opt out** of “sale”/“sharing” for targeted ads (we do not sell/share), **appeal** certain decisions, and to be free from discrimination for exercising rights.

**How to verify (no accounts).** We may ask you to email us from the same address used to contact us (if any) and provide limited details about your request/device/session sufficient to verify your identity while minimizing extra data collection.

**Response time.** We will respond within the time frames required by applicable law.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority/regulator.

---

## 7) Data Transfers

We operate globally. To provide our service, your submitted text and related technical metadata may be transmitted to and processed on servers hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which is an adequacy mechanism recognized under EU law for transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S.

Because we do not retain permanent records of your submitted text or outputs, and minimize metadata and logs, we believe the risk of harm from transfers is low. Where required by applicable law, we rely on AWS’s DPF certification and other lawful transfer mechanisms or safeguards for any third-party processors.

---

## 8) Service Providers (Processors/Sub-Processors)

We use a minimal set of service providers:

| Provider Type | Role | What They Process | Purpose | Safeguards |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AI model provider** (e.g., a generative AI service) | Sub-processor | Input text (transient), output text (transient) | Generate transliteration | Contractual limits; configured no-training/no-reuse settings where offered; security & compliance controls |
| **Cloud/hosting provider** | Infrastructure processor | Network/technical metadata (transient), limited telemetry | Route requests, run serverless functions, reliability & security | Data-processing terms; security certifications; transfer safeguards |

We do **not** authorize providers to use your content for advertising or unrelated purposes. Where providers offer “no-training” or equivalent settings, we enable them.

---

## 9) Do Not Track, GPC, and Opt-Out Signals

We do **not** track you across websites or apps for advertising and we do **not** sell or share your data for targeted ads. Recognized browser opt-out signals (like Global Privacy Control) therefore have no additional effect in this version of SAPO. If our practices change in the future, we will honor applicable signals as required.

---

## 10) Law-Specific Disclosures (Plain Language)

Privacy laws differ by location (e.g., in parts of the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia). **Only the laws of your country or region apply to you.** Our approach is consistent everywhere: collect the minimum needed, discard inputs/outputs after use, avoid selling or sharing data for ads, and respect your local rights. If we hold no personal data about you, we will confirm that when you make a request.

We will update this Policy if future versions of SAPO add features (e.g., accounts, analytics, payments) that trigger additional requirements.

---

## 11) Third-Party Links and Disclosures Required by Law

- **Links.** If you access third-party content from SAPO, your use of that content is governed by the third party’s terms and privacy notice.  
- **Legal requests.** We may disclose information when required by law or a valid legal process. Where permitted, we will notify you before disclosure and will narrow the scope to the minimum legally required.

---

## 12) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy as SAPO evolves (for example, if we add **accounts**, **analytics**, or **payments**). When we make material changes, we will update the **Effective Date** and, where feasible, provide notice (e.g., in-app notice or release notes). New features will include clear, separate disclosures and, where required, consent.

---

## 13) Contact & Complaints

**Contact:** juanmarzabala8a@gmail.com  
We will respond within legally required timelines. You may also contact your local data protection authority/regulator.

---

## 14) Plain-Language Snapshot

- **No accounts. No billing. No ads. No tracking.**  
- Your text is processed **just long enough** to return a transliteration, then **discarded**.  
- We **don’t sell** or **share** your data for targeted ads.  
- You can contact us to exercise your privacy rights; in most cases, we hold **no personal data** to act on.

# S A P O Terms of Use

**Effective Date:** 2025-12-01  
**Version:** v1.0  

These **Terms of Use** (the “**Terms**”) are a legally binding agreement between you and **Happ Technologies Inc.** (“**Happ Technologies**”, “**S A P O**”, “**SAPO**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, or “**our**”) governing your use of:

- The **S A P O mobile app**, and  
- The related **backend services and APIs** we operate (together, the “**Service**” or “**S A P O**”).

Please read these Terms carefully.

By installing, accessing, or using S A P O, you agree to these Terms and to our **S A P O Privacy Policy** (the “**Privacy Policy**”).  
If you do **not** agree, do **not** use S A P O.

---

## 1. Relationship to the Privacy Policy

Our **Privacy Policy** explains **how we collect, use, share, and protect personal data** when you use S A P O, including:

- Account and authentication information  
- Subscription and payment information  
- Text you submit for **phonetic transliteration** and **semantic translation**  
- Technical and usage data  

The Privacy Policy is **incorporated into these Terms by reference**. That means:

- These Terms explain **what you can and cannot do** with S A P O.  
- The Privacy Policy explains **what we do with your data**.  

If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy about data protection, the **Privacy Policy** and **applicable law** will control for privacy and data-protection issues.

You can access the current version of the Privacy Policy **from within the app** and on any website or documentation where we provide it.

---

## 2. Who May Use S A P O

S A P O is intended for individuals who can lawfully enter into a contract and lawfully consent to the processing of their personal data.

- You may use S A P O **only if**:
  - You are at or above the **digital age of consent** in your country (typically 13–16), and  
  - You have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement under the laws of your country, **or** you use the Service with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian if required by local law.

We do **not** knowingly allow accounts for individuals **below the digital age of consent**.  
If we learn that someone below the applicable age is using S A P O without appropriate authorization, we may close or restrict the account and delete related data as described in the Privacy Policy.

By using S A P O, you confirm that you meet these requirements.

---

## 3. What S A P O Does

S A P O uses state-of-the-art third-party AI models to perform:

- **Phonetic transliteration**, and  
- **Semantic translation**  

of the text you choose to submit. These are the core purposes of the Service.

S A P O is a **text transformation and experimentation tool**, not a general-purpose advisory or professional service. It is not designed to provide comprehensive, factual, or domain-specific advice (medical, legal, financial, safety-critical, or otherwise), even if an underlying AI model occasionally generates unexpected content due to user input or model behavior.

To support these core functions, S A P O integrates with third-party providers for authentication, subscriptions, and infrastructure, as described below.

### 3.1 Authentication & Account Infrastructure

Account creation, sign-in, identity verification, and session management are handled by our **authentication provider (Clerk)** and by **OAuth providers** such as Apple and Google.

We receive only the limited information necessary to associate your account with your subscription entitlements and to operate S A P O securely and reliably.

### 3.2 Subscriptions, Purchases, and Payment Processing

Payments, billing, subscription purchases, renewals, and refunds are processed by **independent third-party platforms**, including:

- **Apple In-App Purchases (IAP)** for iOS,  
- **Google Play Billing** (when supported), and  
- **Stripe** (for web or other platforms, when supported).

These providers handle your payment information on their own systems under their own terms and privacy policies. S A P O does **not** process or store your full payment instrument details.

We receive only the **minimal subscription metadata** necessary to confirm your plan, activation status, renewal dates, and token allocation.

### 3.3 Entitlements, Tokens, and Access to Features

Using the subscription status provided by the relevant app store or payment processor, S A P O:

- Determines your **entitlement** (which plan you are on),  
- Tracks **AI token usage** for transliteration and translation,  
- Enforces plan limits fairly, and  
- Provides access to the features associated with your subscription.

S A P O does not operate its own billing system and relies on the app store or payment processor’s confirmation of your purchase to activate or update your entitlements.

---

## 4. Accounts and Sign-In

To use certain features, you may need to create an account or sign in using:

- Apple,  
- Google, and/or  
- Another identity provider we support.

You agree to:

- Provide accurate and up-to-date information where required,  
- Keep your login credentials secure, and  
- Not share your account with others or allow others to use S A P O under your identity.

You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, except where we are at fault.

If you believe your account has been compromised, you must **notify us promptly** at **juanmarzabala8a@gmail.com**.

---

## 5. Subscriptions, Payments, and Token Budgets

Certain features of S A P O may require payment, typically through:

- **App stores** (e.g., Apple App Store, and in the future Google Play), and/or  
- **Payment processors** (e.g., Stripe, on supported platforms).

### 5.1 How Payments Work

- Payments, billing, and refunds are generally handled by the **app store** or **payment processor**, **not** directly by us.  
- Their own **terms and privacy notices** govern how they handle your payment information.  
- We receive **limited subscription information** (like plan, status, order/purchase token, and relevant dates) needed to manage your entitlements, as described in the Privacy Policy.

You must review any applicable terms from the app store or processor you use (e.g., Apple Media Services terms, Google Play terms, Stripe terms).

### 5.2 Subscription Renewal and Cancellation

Unless otherwise stated in the app or app store, **paid subscriptions renew automatically** at the end of each billing period and will continue until canceled.

- Your account (for example, your Apple ID or Google account) will be charged for renewal **within 24 hours prior to the end of the current billing period**, at the price shown for your plan at the time of renewal.
- You can **manage or cancel** your subscription at any time in your app store account settings (for example, in the Apple ID or Google Play subscription settings). Deleting the app **does not** cancel your subscription.

If you cancel, you will retain access to subscription features until the end of the current billing period, and the subscription will not renew. You will not receive a refund or credit for partial periods unless required by applicable law or app store rules.

### 5.3 Token Budgets

Each subscription plan includes a **monthly AI token budget** used to process your requests.

- When you use S A P O, your requests **consume tokens** according to your plan.  
- It is your responsibility to understand your plan limits.  

As explained in the Privacy Policy:

- Any **unused portion** of your monthly AI token budget may be used to run **background AI processes** to expand and improve S A P O’s **open phonetic database**, in a privacy-preserving way.  
- Your **private sessions** are not automatically used as identifiable training data for the open phonetic database without specific consent or proper anonymization.

The details of each plan (pricing, token allocation, renewal cycle, etc.) are shown in the app or app store interface and may change over time in accordance with Section 13 (Changes to These Terms and the Service).

### 5.4 Free Tier

S A P O offers a **free tier** that provides ongoing access to a limited set of features at no cost. The free tier may include access to phonetic transliteration, semantic translation, and other functionality, subject to **usage limits and technical restrictions.**

During the current **beta period**, the free tier may include **more generous token allocations** or broader access than what will be offered after beta. Once beta ends, the free tier may include **reduced or more restricted limits**, especially for token-intensive features such as phonetic transliteration.

The free tier:
	- Has its own **token limits**, which may differ substantially from paid plans
	- Is subject to **fair-use protections and rate limits**
	- May include changes in limits, features, or availability as S A P O evolves

We may modify, limit, or discontinue the free tier at any time, in accordance with applicable law and platform rules. Any such changes will not affect an existing paid subscription unless explicitly stated.

### 5.5 Price Changes

We may change the **prices, plans, or features** of S A P O subscriptions from time to time. If we do, the applicable app store or payment processor will generally notify you of any price changes and, where required by law or platform rules, will request your consent before the new price applies to a **renewing** subscription. If you do not agree to a price change, you may cancel your subscription in your app store account settings before the change takes effect.

## 6. Your Content and How It Is Used

### 6.1 “Your Content”

“**Your Content**” means the text and other material you submit to S A P O so that we can perform phonetic transliteration and semantic translation and return results to you.

You remain the **owner** of Your Content.

### 6.2 License You Grant to Us

To operate S A P O, you grant us and our service providers a **worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license** to:

- Receive, store (as minimally as possible), process, and transform Your Content,  
- Use it to generate outputs with AI models, and  
- Return those outputs to you.

This license exists **only** so that we can operate, secure, troubleshoot, and improve S A P O as explained in these Terms and the Privacy Policy.

### 6.3 Sensitive Content

You should **avoid submitting sensitive personal data** (for example, health information, financial account numbers, government identifiers, or special categories of data) unless strictly necessary.

If you choose to submit such data, you do so **at your own risk**, and its processing is governed by the Privacy Policy and applicable law.

### 6.4 Aggregated and De-Identified Data

As described in the Privacy Policy:

- We may generate **aggregated** or **de-identified** information derived from Your Content and usage (for example, statistics about language pair usage), and  
- We may use that information to improve S A P O, monitor stability, and build a **privacy-preserving open phonetic database** that does **not** identify you personally.

We will **not** publish Your Content in a way that identifies you without your explicit consent, unless we are legally required to do so.

---

## 7. Acceptable Use

You agree **not** to use S A P O (or any part of it):

1. **Unlawfully**  
   - In any way that violates applicable laws or regulations (local, national, or international).  

2. **To harm others**  
   - To harass, threaten, abuse, or defame any person or group.  
   - To submit content that is illegal, hateful, or otherwise harmful.  

3. **For high-risk purposes**  
   - As a sole or primary source of advice in situations where errors could cause **serious harm**, including:
     - Medical, mental health, or pharmaceutical decisions  
     - Legal, financial, or tax decisions  
     - Emergency or life-safety situations  
   - S A P O is not designed or validated for such use.  

4. **To violate rights**  
   - To infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of others.  

5. **To interfere with the Service**  
   - To probe or test the security of S A P O without written permission,  
   - To attempt to bypass any rate limits or access controls,  
   - To use bots, scripts, or automated tools to overload or misuse S A P O, unless explicitly allowed by us.  

6. **To reverse-engineer models**  
   - To intentionally attempt to reverse-engineer or extract underlying model weights, prompts, or proprietary systems used to operate S A P O or our third-party providers, beyond what is allowed by applicable law.

We may **suspend or terminate** your access if we reasonably believe you have violated these acceptable use rules or if required by law or a governmental authority.

---

## 8. AI-Generated Output and No Professional Advice

S A P O is designed **exclusively** to perform:

- **Phonetic transliteration**, and  
- **Semantic translation** of text that you submit.

The Service is **not a general-purpose AI assistant**, and it is **not intended** to generate or provide professional, factual, or domain-specific advice of any kind.

### 8.1 Potential Model Limitations  
S A P O relies on third-party AI models to transform text.  
Because of this:

- Outputs may be **incorrect**, **incomplete**, **inaccurate**, **nonsensical**, or **misaligned** with your expectations.  
- Unexpected outputs may occur due to **prompt injection**, **model behavior**, or **unexpected interactions** with the underlying AI provider.

### 8.2 No Professional Advice  
Even if the underlying AI model generates content outside SAPO’s intended purpose (for example, due to user manipulation or model deviation), you understand and agree that:

- S A P O does **not** provide:  
  - Medical, health, psychological, or pharmacological advice  
  - Legal, financial, tax, or investment advice  
  - Safety-critical, emergency, or crisis-response guidance  
- You must **not** rely on SAPO as a substitute for professional expertise in any domain.

### 8.3 Your Responsibility  
You are solely responsible for how you use and interpret the outputs.  
If you choose to use SAPO outside its intended scope (phonetic transliteration and semantic translation), you do so **at your own risk**, and such use is **not supported**.

---

## 12. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

### 12.1 “As Is” and “As Available”

To the maximum extent permitted by law, S A P O is provided on an **“as is”** and **“as available”** basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including (without limitation):

- Implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement,  
- Any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade,  
- Any warranty that S A P O will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of harmful components.

We may offer S A P O as a **beta** or evolving service. Features may change, improve, or be discontinued over time.

### 12.2 Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by applicable law, Happ Technologies Inc. and its officers, directors, employees, and affiliates will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenues, goodwill, data, or business opportunities, arising out of or related to your use of the Service.

Where our liability cannot be excluded under applicable law, our total aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or relating to the Service or these Terms will be limited to the amount you paid (if any) for access to the Service during the three (3) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, except where prohibited by applicable law.

Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit or exclude liability where such limitation or exclusion is prohibited by law, including liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, and nothing overrides mandatory consumer protections in your country of residence.

## 13. Changes to These Terms and the Service

We may update these Terms from time to time, for example when:

- We add new features or platforms (e.g., Android or web),  
- We change our subscription plans or payment options, or  
- Laws or regulatory guidance evolve.

When we make **material changes**, we will:

- Update the **Effective Date** at the top, and

If you continue using S A P O after the updated Terms become effective, you are agreeing to the new Terms to the extent permitted by law.

We may also modify, suspend, or discontinue parts of S A P O (including features and token plans). Where required by law or app store rules, we will provide notice and, if applicable, refunds or credits in line with those rules.

---

## 14. Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **State of Delaware, USA**, without regard to its conflict-of-laws rules, **except** where the laws of your country of residence require a different choice of law for consumer protection reasons.

Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of S A P O should ideally be resolved **informally** first. You can contact us at **juanmarzabala8a@gmail.com** to attempt to resolve a dispute.

Where informal resolution is not possible:

- You may bring claims in the **courts that have jurisdiction over your place of residence** if required by mandatory consumer protection laws, or  
- Otherwise, in the state or federal courts located in **Delaware, USA**, as applicable.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, **you and we agree** that any disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of S A P O will be resolved on an **individual basis** only. You and we **waive any right** to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.

Courts or tribunals may not consolidate or join your claim with those of any other person or entity without our prior written consent, except where such waivers are not enforceable under applicable law. If you are a consumer in a jurisdiction that does not allow this type of waiver, this paragraph may not apply to you.

Nothing in these Terms limits your right to lodge a complaint with a competent regulatory or data protection authority, as described in the Privacy Policy.

---

## 15. Other Important Terms

- **Entire Agreement.** These Terms and the Privacy Policy together form the **entire agreement** between you and us about S A P O, except for any open-source licenses that apply to the code itself.  
- **Severability.** If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.  
- **No Waiver.** Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms is not a waiver of our right to do so later.  
- **Assignment.** You may not transfer these Terms or your rights and obligations under them without our prior written consent. We may transfer our rights and obligations to another entity (for example, in connection with a merger or acquisition) subject to these Terms and applicable law.
